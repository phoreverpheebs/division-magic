# division-magic

This is just some stuffs I'm writing to better understand the calculation of
the magic in constant division. The implementation being worked with is the one
also used by [LLVM] specifically at the path `llvm-project/llvm/lib/Support/DivisionByConstantInfo.cpp`.
The LLVM implementation is based on Chapter 10 in Hacker's Delight by Henry S. Warren, Jr.

The other goal of this project is for me to learn Haskell, so bear with me if the Haskell code
is terrible. However, if any experienced Haskell ppl come across this repository, I'd really
appreciate feedback <3

merci beacoup mes amours <3
